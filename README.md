# DataScience
A repository to hold some data science projects from miscellaneous subjects

Here is what I've got so far:

# 1 - [Facebook Statistics - Catraca Livre](./FacebookStatistics)

Fetching all 600k+ posts from [Catraca Livre](https://www.facebook.com/CatracaLivre) (a really popular Brazilian page that was being criticized on its posting habits) through the Facebook Graph API, building a consolidated json, and plotting some charts with all the data to enable analyzing what has been posted.

# 2 - [Corruption Scandal Investigation - Word cloud](./CorruptionScandalAnalysis)

Using published documents of depositions from a current brazilian political corruption investigation called [Lava Jato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Car_Wash). Generating the set of most common words, which were used to create a word cloud.
