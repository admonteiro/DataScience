# DataScience
A repository to hold some data science projects from miscellaneous subjects

Here is what I've got so far:

# 1 - [Facebook Statistics](./FacebookStatistics)

Fetching all 600k+ posts from a Facebook page through the Facebook Graph API, building a consolidated json, and plotting some charts with all the data to enable analyzing what has been posted.

# 2 - [Corruption Scandal Analysis](./CorruptionScandalAnalysis)

Using all the published documents of a current investigation called Lava Jato, which is aimed towards a giant political corruption scandal in Brazil. Generating word clouds, charts, timelines, maps and extracting insights.
